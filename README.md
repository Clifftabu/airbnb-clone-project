# Airbnb Clone Project

# Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a real WORLD application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform.It focuses on creating a scalable backend system using modern technologies, enabling users to manage properties, make bookings, and process payments securely. 

# Project Goals
- Develop a fully functional backend for a booking platform similar to Airbnb.
- Ensure high scalability, maintainability, and security in the system.
- Implement and showcase industry best practices in backend development.

# Tech stack
- Django:Web framework used for backend development and API design.
- MySQL: A relational database for storing and managing data.
- GraphQL: Query language for APIs to enable efficient and flexible data 
  fetching.
- Docker: For containerization, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.

# Team Roles
-Backend Developer:
  Responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the backend logic and APIs. Ensures robust application performance and data management.
- Database Administrator :
  Focuses on designing and managing the database structure, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing database performance.
- DevOps Engineer:
  Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines, automates deployments, and ensures system scalability using tools like Docker.
- Project Manager:
  Oversees project timelines and ensures collaboration among team members and to achieve project goals effectively.

# Database Design
The key entities are:
1. Users:
   - id (Primary Key)
   - name
   - email
   - password (encrypted)
   - role (e.g., guest, host)
2. Properties:
   - id (Primary Key)
   - name
   - location
   - description
   - price_per_night
   - host_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
3. Bookings:
   - id (Primary Key)
   - property_id (Foreign Key referencing Properties)
   - user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)
   - start_date
   - end_date
   - total_price
4. Payments:
   - id (Primary Key)
   - booking_id (Foreign Key referencing Bookings)
   - amount
   - payment_date
   - payment_status
Beloq are the entities' relationships:
- A user can own multiple properties (one-to-many).
- A property can have multiple bookings (one-to-many).
- A user can book multiple properties (one-to-many).
- A booking is associated with one payment (one-to-one).

# Feature Breakdown
 Users Management
-Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts and guests are assigned different roles to allow property listing and booking.
Property Management
-Hosts can list properties with details like location, price, and availability. They can also update or evem remove their listings.
Booking System
-Guests can search for properties, view if available, and book them for specific dates. Bookings are tracked in the system for both guests and hosts.
Payment Integration
-payment processing is included for guests to pay for booking. Payment statuses are tracked directly.
Searching and filtering
Users can search for properties by location, date, price range, and other criteria to find the perfect stay.

# API Security

To ensure the security, we use:

-Authentication  
   Users must authenticate themselves using secure login mechanisms, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth, ensuring only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

-Authorization  
   After authentication, users are granted specific access based on their role (e.g, guest or host). For example,only hosts can manage properties and only guests can make bookings.

-Rate Limiting  
   To protect against abuse or malicious attacks (ie brute force attacks). This limits the number of requests a user can make within a specified time.

-Data Encryption  
   All sensitive data, such as passwords and payment details, will be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

-Secure Payment Processing
   Payments will be processed through credible third-party services(ie PayPal) to ensure security during transactions. Payment details will not be stored on the platform.
